# *QUICK START GUIDE*


The Stateshaper Engine will give you a list/array of deterministic numbers to tokenize for use to call events or define variables in your logic. 

For continuous use, the engine can be called in a loop using the *run_engine* function. For one time, call it once with a specific *token_count* parameter.

To create the same output again, *start_engine* needs to be called once more.

<h3><b><u>Steps<br>
--------
</b></h3> 


1\. Make sure your data is in one of the formats listed in the *"example_data"* directory. If needed, use the *FormatData* class in the nested *'format_data'* directory.

Instructions: [`Formatting Data for Input`](example_data/format_data/FORMAT_DATA.md)

<br> 

2\. Initialize a *RunEngine* class 


**IMPORTANT!**
***To create determinism, the same initial state, constants and mod value are required each time the engine starts.***
***Not needed if no custom values were passed originally***

```python
# data (REQUIRED) - the input data. must be in a format listed in the 'example_data' directory
# seed (optional) - required to recreate a previous run of the engine. it is created after the first run of the engine and can be retrieved using the 'get_seed' function from the main class. when used, no other parameters other than token count need to be specified. if no custom parameters are set, only the state format data in the "v" key needs to be included. (ex. seed={"v": ["ABC12345", "BVCH457SZ"]})
# token_count (default=10) - The desired size of the list containing your input terms.
# initial_state (default=[66, 67, 54, 3, 34]) - The original starting values to base the chain on.
# constants (optional) - Only change this for custom morphing equations.
# mod (optional) - Only change this for custom morphhing equations

from stateshaper import RunEngine 

#BASIC (first run)
engine = RunEngine(data=your_data, token_count=needed_tokens)

# RE-CREATE PREVIOUS OUTPUT
engine = RunEngine(data=your_data, seed=created_seed, token_count=needed_tokens)

#CUSTOM
engine = RunEngine(data=your_data, seed=created_seed, token_count=needed_tokens, initial_state=optional_custom_logic, constants=optional_custom_logic, mod=more_optional_logic)

engine.start_engine()

# TO GET NEEDED VALUES TO RE-CREATE THE SAME OUTPUT
# Not needed if no custom values were originally passed. 
engine.get_seed()

# With compressed vocab
engine.get_seed(vocab=True)
```

<br>

3\. Call the *run_engine* method.

```python
engine.run_engine()

# OUTPUT    
#
# ["your", "input", "values", "are", "returned", "based", "on", "chosen", "stateshaper", "rules"]
```

<br>

4\. OPTIONAL Call the *rebuild* method or re-instantiate the class to start from the beginning.

```python
engine.rebuild()

# OR

engine = RunEngine(data=your_data, seed=create_seed, token_count=needed_tokens)
```


Whatever the decided use is, this tool can achieve it using almost no stored memory. 

Unlimited sequences of data can be re-created from a small seed, including fully personalized user profiles. 

Privacy is achieved through obfuscation. The data can't be interpreted without using the seed as a key.
